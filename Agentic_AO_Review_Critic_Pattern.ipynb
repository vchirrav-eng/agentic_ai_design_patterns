An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands through the `sql_query` argument, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. To fix this, always use parameterized queries (e.g., `cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\", (user_id,))`) instead of string formatting or direct concatenation for user-supplied values in SQL queries.
